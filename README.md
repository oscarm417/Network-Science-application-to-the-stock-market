Applying network science to a network model of the stock market.
The network is a correlation matrix of all stocks in the stock market. Correlations below 0.9 where removed to create a scale free network. The scale free network was then 
analyzed for eigenvector centrality and egree centrality. These where then compared to the volatility, return, and sharpe ratio of a stocks performance in order to identify 
network properties that indicate higher stock returns. 


Despite the highly disorganized data analysis employed it was discovered that stocks with low network centrality have above average sharpe ratios. 
Sharp Ratio is a risk adjusted return. However, low centrality stocks also showed a clustered of below average returns. Meaning stocks selected from areas of low centrality contain the most alpha to be extracted by further fianancial analysis and market trend forecasting.
